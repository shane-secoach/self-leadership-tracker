Subject: Thanks for today — a clear reset for the next two weeks

Thank you for the honesty you brought to today’s session. We used this time to slow things down, take stock of what is working, and focus on a practical way for you to lead your days with more intention.

The key themes were the pressure of constant meetings, feeling pulled into urgency, and your wish to move from reacting to leading. We also noticed the value of your recent wins, especially handling a difficult email and getting back to the gym, as proof that steady action is already happening.

The main decision was to trial your morning reset routine for the next two weeks. That includes protecting deep-work time, keeping your phone away for the first part of the morning, and setting your top three priorities the night before. We also noted that travel and team response expectations may make this harder, so the focus is on consistency rather than perfection.

I appreciate the commitment you showed today. Keep it simple, keep it deliberate, and we’ll build from what you learn in real time.
