## CRM Reverse Engineering

* Goal: Move away from static Word tables toward an integrated tracking system.
* Initial Data Requirements:  
   * Name and Contact Details (Primary: Email and WhatsApp/Phone).  
   * Conversation history.  
   * Suggested next steps/actions.
* Project Categorization: Work types are currently "completely different" and lack uniform structure.
* **Agreement:** Start by defining high-level "chunks" (disciplines) of information to build specific AI prompts for a custom dashboard.

## Information Chunking Strategy

* Method: "Reverse engineering" the CRM by identifying broad categories before specific details.
* Analogy: Categorizing "Vehicles" as a high-level chunk before drilling down into specific types.
* Objective: Create a hierarchy of data to allow for more specific and effective AI-generated tools.

#### 8m

## Categorization & Dashboarding

* Shane proposes "Chunking" data to organize work streams  
   * Top Level: Methods of Transport (Global view)  
   * Mid Level: Vehicles (Work categories)  
   * Low Level: Specifics (Red car/Blue car)
* Visualizing a Business Dashboard  
   * Metrics: Tracking lead volume per category (e.g., 6 in CRM, 10 in social media)  
   * Purpose: Identifying high-growth areas vs. low-priority tasks over time
* **Agreement:** Implementation of a dashboard to monitor lead volume across TV, Social Media, and Speaking engagements

## Work Streams & Pipeline

   * Arts, Social Media, Social Value, TV/Film, and Training/Editing.
* Training priorities:  
   * Practical application with "bigger and better" camera gear.  
   * Software mastery: Learning new editing techniques.
* Current organizational friction:  
   * Utilizing a physical whiteboard; client feels it lacks necessary "pings" or urgency.  
   * **Agreement:** Information needs to be segmented into a dashboard to prevent data overwhelm.

## System Requirements & CRM Development

* Dashboard Data Fields:  
   * Name, Email, WhatsApp, Work Type (e.g., Editing), Project Scope (e.g., 1hr presentation to TV documentary), and "Next Contact" notes.
* Functional needs:  
   * High-level "at a glance" visual status for momentum tracking.  
   * Deep-dive CRM (Client Relationship Management) for granular project work.

   * Current stack is fragmented/unclear; user has access to Microsoft and Google packages but lacks a defined system.

#### 13m

## CRM Strategy & Tooling

* Current Software Inventory:  
   * Speaker 1 uses Google Workspace (Gmail) but performs primary work in Microsoft Word.  
   * Confirmed access to Microsoft Excel.
* CRM Recommendations:  
   * Excel is the designated starting point for low-volume client management.  
   * SharePoint or SharePoint Lists suggested as the next tier of complexity.  
   * Bespoke systems only required at scale (e.g., £2M+ annual turnover or 100+ clients).
* **Agreement:** Start with a simple, manual process/spreadsheet to maintain daily consistency.

## Spreadsheet Architecture

* Essential Data Columns:  
   * Client Name.  
   * Contact Details (Email and WhatsApp).  
   * Types of Work.  
   * Deep-dive details/Notes.

   * Data Fields: Name, WhatsApp number, Work type (drop-down), Project notes, Source (Networking/Event), and Next Contact.
* CRM Purpose: Centralized repository for client interaction history, action points, and shared team access.
* Analogy: Call center systems where sales and service teams input specific customer interaction logs.

#### 23m

## CRM Fundamentals & Data Management

* CRM utility: Centralizes customer info (CRM/Sales/Service inputs) to avoid fragmented data.
* "Actionable Points": Systems track next steps to ensure momentum with individual leads.
* Glenith (Contact): Example of workflow—referral to "social value guy" requires a meeting "next stage."
* The "Head" Method: Common pitfall where contacts from Email, WhatsApp, and Social Media are tracked mentally rather than logged.
* Spreadsheet solution: Serves as a manual backup to track when to "drop a ring" or send reminders.

## Shane’s Workflow & Personal Systems

* Current System: Shane admits most tracking is "in my head" or via a sporadic Excel spreadsheet.
* "Ping" Strategy: Shane relies on spontaneous messaging; often results in reactive new work/leads.
* The "Sketchy Head" Risk: Speaker 1 expresses concern over "dropping balls" while transitioning from project execution to business development.
* Operational Gap: High discipline required daily to convert task lists into actual CRM updates.

#### 25m

## Lead Pipeline Management

* Challenges with "sketchy head" and project tunnel vision  
   * Risk of "dropping balls" when transitioning from delivery back to sales  
   * Gap in workload: 1-3 month projects lead to "What's next?" panic upon completion
* Strategic lead time: Shane recommends reaching out to prospects 4–8 weeks in advance
* Two-step CRM approach:  
   * Step 1: Consolidate all data in one location  
   * Step 2: Utilize dashboards/automation for visualization

## CRM Data Structure & Validation

* Contact ID (0001): Automated via formula to ensure unique tracking.
* Preferred Channel & Social Media: Utilizes drop-down lists rather than manual text entry.  
   * Prevents data fragmentation (e.g., "WhatsApp" vs. "What's up").  
   * Essential for accurate dashboarding and filtering.
* Data Entry Standards:  
   * Manual entry: Name (Alex Example), Email, and More Detail.  
   * Automation potential: Next Contact Date currently manual but open to formula integration.
* **Agreement:** Use drop-down lists to force standardized inputs for consistent reporting.

## Formatting & Future Automation

* Conditional Formatting: Proposed to visually differentiate statuses or categories via color coding.
* Status Tracking: Identified as a drop-down list to maintain pipeline integrity.
* Formula Exploration: Audit of all columns conducted to identify which fields remain manual versus automated.

#### 31m

## Excel Automation via ChatGPT

* **Objective:** Automate "Next Contact Date" column to flag follow-ups.
* **Formula Logic:** Add 30 days to the "Last Contact Date" to trigger visual alerts (e.g., turning the cell red).
* **ChatGPT Workflow:**  
   * Copy column title: `next contact date manual`.  
   * Prompt used: "Give me a formula for this column so it gives me a date in 30 days."
* **Implementation Steps:**  
   * Paste formula into cell below header.  
   * Drag-and-drop the fill handle (bottom right cross) to apply to the entire column.
* **Formula Refinement:**  
   * Initial formula used `TODAY()` and calculated 30 working days (Mon-Fri).  
   * **Agreement:** Manual override to reference specific cell data.  
   * Change `TODAY()` to cell reference `K2` to link the 30-day increment specifically to the last contact date.

#### 34m

* Column K: Identified as the "Last Contact Date" reference for the formula
* Objective: Calculate 32 working days based on Column K
* Formula Refinement:  
   * Initial attempt using cell **K2** resulted in a #REF! error  
   * Identified data is formatted as an **Excel Table**, requiring structured references rather than standard cell IDs  
   * **Agreement:** Use the "Excel table version" of the code provided by AI to handle structured headers
* Troubleshooting Steps:  
   * Copy "Last Contact Date" header into AI chat to re-map the formula  
   * **Agreement:** Take a screenshot of the current Excel error warning to feed back into the chat for precise debugging  
   * Shane to guide the user through capturing the screen on their laptop

#### 38m

## Excel Troubleshooting & Formula Correction

* Excel Cell Referencing  
   * Speaker 1 mistakenly pasted a formula into the Name Box instead of cell **L2/L3**  
   * Initial error involved a "table reference" versus "normal range" formula  
   * Shane directed Speaker 1 to use the "normal range" formula from the chat log
* Data Entry & Formatting  
   * **26 2026 / 0201**: Specific date strings identified for correction  
   * Manual entry of new test date: **6/8/8/8** (placeholder) and **04**  
   * **Agreement:** Shane and Speaker 1 agreed to use **Format Cells > Date/Custom** to standardize the display of the "Last Contact Date" column

## Dynamic Column Behavior

* Formula Validation  
   * Successfully used **Control + V** to paste the corrected `IF` statement  
   * Drag-and-drop applied to the column to "blank out" irrelevant cells

   * Select first data cell (excluding header) in the target column.  
   * Action: `Control` \+ `Shift` \+ `Down Arrow` to highlight the entire range.  
   * Navigation: **Home Tab** \> **Conditional Formatting** \> **New Rule**.  
   * Rule Type: Select "Use a formula to determine which cells to format."
* **Formula Implementation:**  
   * **Agreement:** Copied specific code/formula from Chat history into the "Format values where this formula is true" box.  
   * Target: Highlight cells occurring within the **next 7 days**.
* **Verification:**  
   * Initial check showed no highlighted cells because no dates fell within the upcoming week.  
   * **Agreement:** Manually change a date in the last column to a current date to test if the formatting triggers correctly.

#### 47m

## Spreadsheet Formula & Date Correction

* **Ali** manually overtyped formulas in columns **K** and **L** (Row 3).
* Date corrections discussed:  
   * Last contact date: \~3 months ago.
